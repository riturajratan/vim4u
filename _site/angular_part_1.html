<h1>Hi this is a all about that how to learn Angular js </h1>

<p>So First</p>

<h1>What is angular js ?</h1>
<p>It is a Javascript framework which provide intericity with HTML</p>

<h1>Before you start what would you need to know </h1>

<p>HTML, CSS and Javascript is necesary to work with AngularJS and if you know jquery that will be good else no worry.</p>

<h1>WHy you use this </h1>
<p>For sinle page application it is too good.

easily work with jquery

easy to test

provide a modular approach to your code

and one and most good feature you need to write very small code for its two way data binding feature(we will discuss it no worry)
</p>

In the Angular Main thing is Directives
 what is directive

 In our html when we add this as a tag  then angular js know that it work on this palace for javascript code.

 like a demo
 in our normal Work

 <code>

 	<!DOCTYPE html>
 	<html>
 	<head>
 		<title></title>
 	</head>
 	<body onload="hello()">

 	</body>
 	</html>
 </code>
and for angular we will write

<code>
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html ng-app="Test">// here we say to angular that start from this tag
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body ng-controller="hello"> // here angular take a coomand from us that it shoud execute hello function and it alert "hello"

	</body>
	</html>

</code>


OK Now let's come to the  point how you will start with work in angular js ?

<h1>ng-app (Angular Module)</h1> say to angular js active on which poretion of page

First in your html like below
<code>

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body ng-app="">//Now it Tells to AngularJS to be active in this portion of the page. In this case the entire document.(due to we apply on html tag )
	 <div>
	<!--   <input type="text" ng-model="testName" placeholder="Enter a name here">
      <h1>Hello, {{ yourName }}!</h1> -->
	</div>
	</body>
	</html>
</code>

<div>
	  <input type="text" ng-model="testName" placeholder="Enter a name here">
      <h1>Hello Test, {{ testName }}!</h1>
	</div>

Here we see two way data binding( bi-directional data binding )without any work this is the featute of angular js when you will change in bacend changes are shown on view . thsi is the magic of angular js .

Here we see three things
ng-app= here we say to start Angular js on our page
ng-model="testName" = by this we say two way data binding start on this testName model on this page.
{{ testName}} =here angular show changes on testName model on this directive



Module is a collection of function which is inisiate when this module is called

Now we make a module in angular js

var TestModule=angular.module("myModule",[]);

myModule= is the name of module by which module is made

[] = this is use for dependiency like this moduile depends on which module rigth now dont worry about it we will discuss it :)


now how will we use this module simple
now in our html we will put in ng-app="myModule"

in below module active on all page
<code>
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html ng-app="myModule">
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>

	</body>
	</html>
</code>
in below this is active on a specific div
<code>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<div ng-app="myModule">

</div>
</body>
</html>
</code>

After initilize module we will need to write our all logic by which we polay with angular for this we need $scope, ng-controller,directive ,service,routing
we will come it one by one

so first start with $scope
<h1>$$cope on Angular js </h1>
now go to next article
</body>
</html>
<script type="text/javascript">

	function hello(){

alert("hello");

	}
</script>
